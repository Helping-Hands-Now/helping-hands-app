  "donationPageSection1ContentB": "Because we are an organization started and led by business and technology leaders who are volunteering their time, your donation goes to delivering food and other essential items into the hands of individuals and families who need it most. They are the 54 million+ people in our communities who homebound, who are time starved, who don’t have access to transportation – and most importantly, who need our commitment, our generosity, our helping hands to survive.",
  "donationPageSection2Title": "How does my donation help?",
  "donationPageSection2Content": "The majority of your donation dollars will be used to directly subsidize the cost of goods delivered. We also use donations to support administrative costs necessary to ensure that our “last mile” delivery is safe and reliable – including background checks and hosting fees.",
  "donationPageLegalText": "Now Helping Hands is a nonprofit public benefit corporation organized in the state of California. Our certification for 501(c)(3) status has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service, thus all charitable donations qualify as tax-deductible under Internal Revenue Code section 170.

  "faq": "FAQ",
  "faqSection1Head": "Requesting Help",
  "faqSection2Head": "Volunteering",
  "faqSection3Head": "About Helping Hands",
  "faq1Answer1": "Helping Hands is intended to help the most at-risk members of our community stay safely at home during the COVID-19 crisis. This includes those over 65, the immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing medical conditions that put them at greater risk. It also includes caregivers who cannot safely leave the cared for, and medical workers who need a little help between shifts.",
  "faq1Answer2": "Bottom line: This service is for everyone who needs it, and only those who need it. And if you need it, please use it a lot. We’re all in this together. And together, we’ll flatten the curve and get through this.",
  "faq1Question": "Who can request help?",
  "faq2Answer": "Helping Hands volunteers can help you with errands outside of your home so that you can stay home. Common requests include grocery runs, prescription pick up, mail pick up, and even dog walking. Your request will appear, exactly as you write it, on the Helping Hands site for volunteers located near you to accept.",
  "faq2Question": "What kind of help can I request?",
  "faq3Answer": "Nope! Helping Hands is a free meeting place that connects volunteers with people who cannot leave their homes. But remember: while delivery is free, you still need to purchase the goods that you request, or reimburse your helper for them.",
  "faq3Question": "Does Helping Hands cost money?",
  "faq4Answer1": "There are a few ways for you to pay for the goods that the volunteer is delivering for you:",
  "faq4Answer2": "When possible, we recommend that you call the store, tell them the items you would like, and pay over the phone with your credit card and let the store know that someone else will be picking them up for you.",
  "faq4Answer3": "You can also use a digital/mobile payment platform, like PayPal, Venmo, or Apply Pay, to instantly pay your helper.",
  "faq4Answer4": "Otherwise, you can pay with a check or cash. We recommend leaving it in an envelope outside the door so your helper can leave the bag and pick up the money without coming within six feet of each other. Use a cleaning wipe to wipe down the cash and the delivered items. Wash your hands immediately and as possible throughout this process.",
  "faq4Question": "How do I reimburse the volunteer?",
  "faq5Answer1": "There is absolutely no expectation to tip volunteers who are offering their time to help keep our community safe at home. We are just here to help.",
  "faq5Answer2": "Verbally communicating your gratitude to your helper for their time and effort is wonderful and is much appreciated, whether you do that over the phone or when the helper comes to deliver your items, while practicing social distancing or from behind closed doors! If you are so inclined, and also want to give a tip, we encourage you to do so in a contactless way, like Venmo, or in an envelope.",
  "faq5Question": "Do I need to tip the volunteer?",
  "faq6Answer": "The Helping Hands platform can work anywhere in the United States, so long as there are volunteers signed up and requests being made. Please make a request if you have one, volunteer if you can, and spread the word! The more people who know about Helping Hands, the better it will work for everyone.",
  "faq6Question": "Is Helping Hands in my community?",
  "faq7Question": "Who can volunteer?",
  "faq8Question": "Can I volunteer if I am under 18 years of age?",
  "faq9Question": "Can I bring someone with me to volunteer?",
  "faq10Answer1": "Help us flatten the curve of the COVID-19 infection by spreading the word about our organization! With your support, we can reach more people in need.",
  "faq10Answer3": "Copy and paste the email below and send it to your friends!",
  "faq10Answer5": "We hope to soon open Helping Hands for volunteer opportunities that you can safely complete from home. In the meantime, want to do more? Email joinus@helpinghands.community and let us know what you can do.",
  "faq10Question": "I’d like to volunteer, but I can’t make deliveries. How can I help?",
  "faq11Question": "Does Helping Hands have a privacy policy?",
  "faq12Answer1": "Helping Hands only shows a requestor’s first name, city, and zip code so that volunteers can determine if they can help with a request. They will also see any information that you enter in the free text fields about your profile and your request details.",
  "faq12Answer2": "When a volunteer accepts a request, the volunteer and requestor will receive each other’s phone numbers in order to coordinate the request details. Helping Hands does not share the requestors address; the requestor provides their delivery address to the volunteer when they are comfortable to share.",
  "faq12Question": "Will my contact information be shown on the site?",
  "faq13Question": "Is Helping Hands a nonprofit organization?",
  "faq14Question": "How can I donate to Helping Hands?",
  "faq15Answer": "Donations will be used to directly subsidize the cost of delivered goods (such as food and medicine) for individuals in need. The Helping Hands platform is free to use, so we will also use donations to support administrative costs--like background checks and hosting fees, that allow us to operate reliably and safely--which we keep very low as a 100% volunteer-powered organization.",
  "faq15Question": "What are donations to Helping Hands used for?",
  "faq16Answer": "Now Helping Hands is a nonprofit public benefit corporation organized in the state of California.   As a newly formed nonprofit in response to COVID-19, we are in the process of applying for Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3) tax-exemption.  IRS review of our application may take approximately 6 months from our anticipated May submission date. Upon IRS approval of our application, your donation will be tax deductible retroactively and at that time we would provide you with the information relevant to your ability to deduct your donation.  We are confident in the materials we submitted and our nonprofit mission and expect to receive tax exempt status. There is a chance that our application may not be approved, in which case your donation would not qualify as a charitable deduction under Internal Revenue Code section 170. If you have any concerns, we  suggest that you consult with a tax adviser on this issue. Should you complete your donation, we will notify you as soon as we have received a response from the IRS.",
  "faq16Question": "Does Helping Hands have 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status?",
  "faq17Answer": "No, not yet. We do plan to make Helping Hands available outside of the United States eventually. If you would like to see Helping Hands in your country, please email community@helpinghands.comunity.",
  "faq17Question": "Is Helping Hands available outside of the US?",
