            Welcome to Helping Hands. Please read on to learn the rules and
            restrictions that govern your use of{" "}
            <a href="/">www.HelpingHands.community</a> and our other website(s),
            products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have
            any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the
            Services, please contact us at{" "}

          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you
            and Now Helping Hands., Inc., a California nonprofit public benefit
            corporation (“Helping Hands,” “we” and “us”). Sometimes when we
            refer to “Helping Hands” we may also mean certain third parties that
            we work with. You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you
            don’t have the right to use the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of
            these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the
            Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as
            well as those in the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.

          <h2>About Helping Hands</h2>
          <p>
            Helping Hands is a non-profit who, through the Services, provides a
            way to let users who wish to volunteer time and resources
            (“Volunteers”) to contact and provide certain services to other
            users who wish to receive certain services (either on behalf of
            themselves or their organizations) ( “Partners”) through the use of
            Logistic Providers. These interactions are between different users,
            and while the Services may help facilitate these interactions,
            Helping Hands has no control over and does not guarantee: the
            existence, quality, safety or legality of content, goods, or
            services provided or requested by users; the truth or accuracy of
            users’ content, goods, services, or requests, the ability of Partner
            to receive services by Volunteers; the ability of Volunteers to
            provide any services, or that a Volunteer or Partner will
            successfully engage with a Logistics Provider to complete an
            exchange of content, goods, or services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>NOTICE: Please read these Terms carefully.</strong> They
            cover important information about Services provided to you and any
            charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. These Terms include
            information about future changes to these <a href="/terms">Terms</a>
            , <a href="#limitations">limitations of liability</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>Will these Terms ever change? </h2>
          <p>
            We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
            need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to
            change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your
            attention by placing a notice on the www.HelpingHands.community
            website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
            unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
            Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the
            Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
            modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and
            signed by both you and us.
          </p>

            warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that
            organization, entity or individual’s behalf and bind them to these
            Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these
            Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization,
            entity or individual).
          </p>
          <p>
            You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal,

            is prohibited by applicable laws or are outside the scope of your
            authority, then you may not use the Services. We can’t and won’t be
            responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law
            or violates any contractual arrangements you have with an
            organization or on behalf of an individual.

          <p>
            As part of the Services, you may receive communications through the
            Services, including messages that Helping Hands sends you (for

            Logistical Provider. When signing up for the Services, you will
            receive a welcome message and instructions on how to stop receiving

            HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM HELPING HANDS or a
            Volunteer, Partner or Logistical Provider. You agree to indemnify
            and hold Helping Hands or a Volunteer, Partner or Logistical
            Provider harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
            damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including
            attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to your breach
            of the foregoing.

            your right to use or access the Services.
          </p>
          <h2>What are my rights in the Services? </h2>
          <p>
            The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the
            Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data,
            articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so
            forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by
            copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to
            abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and
            restrictions contained in any Content you access through the
            Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate,

            license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose
            any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the
            owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s
            (including Helping Hands’s) rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            You understand that Helping Hands owns the Services. You won’t
            modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of,
            reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create
            derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content;
            please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t
            mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!
          </p>
          <h2>
            Do I have to grant any licenses to Helping Hands or to other users?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide
            through the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User
            Submissions may be viewable by other users. In order to display your
            User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy
            them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User
            Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are
            subject to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> to the extent
            they relate to User Submissions that are also your
            personally-identifiable information.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Helping Hands a license
            to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making
            sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer)
            and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User
            Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as
            described in more detail below. This is a license only – your
            ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you store a User Submission in your own personal Helping Hands
            account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except
            you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Helping Hands the
            license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and
            distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of
            making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing
            the Services necessary to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you share a User Submission publicly (e.g., you request services
            and provide certain contact information) on the Services and/or in a
            manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view,
            or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any
            feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature
            requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a “Public
            User Submission”), then you grant Helping Hands the licenses above,
            as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public
            User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User
            Submission accessible to all Helping Hands users and third parties
            who are not Helping Hands users and providing the Services necessary
            to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise
            all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the
            Services and/or otherwise in connection with Helping Hands’s
            operations and services. Also, you grant all other users of the
            Services and third parties who are not users of the Services a
            license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and
            exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the
            Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual,
            sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you
            delete your Helping Hands account, we will stop displaying your User
            Submissions [(other than Public User Submissions, which may remain
            fully available)] to other users (if applicable), but you understand
            and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that
            content from Helping Hands’s records, and that your User Submissions
            may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or
            stored by other users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, you understand and agree that Helping Hands, in performing
            the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users
            (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions
            to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical
            requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media,
            and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.

            of any such dealings.

            If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between
            users and any third party, you agree that Helping Hands is under no
            obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute
            with one or more other users, you release Helping Hands, its
            directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims,
            demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown,
            suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of
            or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you
            are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California
            Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not
            extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
            exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if
            known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
            debtor."

          <h2>Will Helping Hands ever change the Services? </h2>
          <p>
            We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over
            time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we
            may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or
            restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give
            you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would
            adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we
            reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any
            time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone
            alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms),
            in our sole discretion, and without notice.
          </p>
          <h2> Do the Services cost anything? </h2>
          <p>
            The Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge
            for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before
            any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you
            wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable
            fees for such Services.
          </p>
          <p>What if I want to stop using the Services? </p>
          <p>
            You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at{" "}

            Helping Hands is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your
            use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our
            discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Helping Hands has
            the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the
            restrictions set forth in these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Account termination may result in destruction of any Content
            associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide
            to terminate your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of
            these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the
            following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay
            us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms
            regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms
            regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the
            arbitration agreement.
