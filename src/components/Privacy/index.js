          <h2>What Information does Helping Hands Collect?</h2>
          <p>
            <em>Information You Provide to Us:</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.
            For example, through the registration process and/or through your
            account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your
            name, email address, phone number, and third-party account
            credentials and information (for example, your log-in credentials
            for Facebook or other third party sites or information you provided
            for the purpose of background check). If you provide your
            third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the
            Services through a third party site or service, you understand some
            content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account
            Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that
            Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is
            covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, if you sign in with
            Facebook, Facebook provides Helping Hands some information and
            content related to you. Certain information may be required to
            register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do
            so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send
            you promotional email offers on behalf of other organizations, or
            email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a
            confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps
            us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our
            services. If you do not want to receive communications from us,
            please indicate your preference by opting out through the
            appropriate communication channel (e.g., by opting out of email
            communications by clicking the unsubscribe link provided in such
            emails). We may continue to send you only transaction emails and
            legal updates.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We also collect information about and from certain Volunteers. In
            order to become a volunteer for Helping Hands, volunteers must
            provide us with a username and password, their name, address, phone
            number, email address, physical address, birthdate, driver’s license
            number or other state or federal ID number and social security
            number.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may access but do not store certain information about our
            Logistics Providers, such as name and phone number for support
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also perform background checks on Helping Hands volunteers using
            a third party background check provider, who gives us access to the
            background check information and results. While we can access the
            background check information, we do not store it.

            <em>Information Collected Automatically</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive
            and record information on our server logs from your browser or
            device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device
            identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or
            device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature
            you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser
            or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell
            us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and
            by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on
            your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance
            of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some
            of our features.{" "}

          <p>
            We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you
            might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to
            improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often
            Users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that
            knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as
            possible.{" "}

          <p>
            Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect
            information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
            Just like any other usage information we collect, this information
            allows us to improve the Services and customize your online
            experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your
            browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to
            signal to operators of websites and web applications and services
            (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish
            such operators to track certain of your online activities over time
            and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not
            Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information
            about your online activity both while you are using the Services and
            after you leave our Services.

          <h2>
            Will Helping Hands Share Any of the Personal Information it
            Receives?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally
            identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information
            with third parties as described in this section:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Other Helping Hands Volunteers.</strong> Depending on your
            preferences we make certain Personal Information that belongs to you
            public on the Services. For example, if you request help, we will
            share your name, contact information (e.g., phone number, email) and
            information about your request public on our Services so volunteers
            can fulfill your request. If you wish to volunteer and seek to aid
            any Recipients through the Services, we will make certain Personal
            Information that you provided public on the Services (e.g., name,
            contact information) such that the User requesting help can contact
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Information that’s been de-identified.</strong> We may
            de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified
            as an individual, and provide that information to our Partners. We
            may also provide aggregate usage information to our Partners (or
            allow Partners to collect that information from you), who may use
            such information to understand how often and in what ways people use
            our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal
            online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or
            de-identified information to a Partner (or allow a partner to
            collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an
            individual person.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Affiliated Partners:</strong> In certain situations,
            organizations or third party websites we’re affiliated with may
            provide products or services to you through or in connection with
            the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize
            when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or
            service, and we will share your Personal Information with that
            affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such
            transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and
            practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or
            anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or
            service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review
            all such business’ or websites’ policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Logistics Providers</strong> We employ other companies and
            people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your
            information with them to provide products or services to you. In
            order to accept services from these third parties, you may have to
            agree to their terms of service and privacy policy. Unless we tell
            you differently, our Logistics Providers do not have any right to
            use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is
            necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered
            a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the
            terms of the “<strong>Information that’s been de-identified</strong>
            ” section in that regard. We anticipate the number and particular
            Logistics Providers we work with to vary from time to time.{" "}

            <strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong> Certain User profile
            information, including your name, location, and any video or image
            content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be
            displayed to other Users to facilitate user interaction within the
            Services or address your request for our services. Please remember
            that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with
            any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose
            online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in
            messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can
            be collected and used by anyone. Your Username may also be displayed
            to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload
            images or videos through the Services and other users can contact
            you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into
            the Services through a third party social networking site or
            service, we may gain access to and store certain personal
            information about you like name, phone number and photo URL.
            Similarly, that site or service may be able to access certain
            non-public information you have entered in your Services user
            profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any
            other third party site or service.

          <h2>Will Helping Hands ever change this Privacy Policy?</h2>
          <p>
            We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to
            change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will
            alert you to changes by placing a notice on
            https://helpinghands.community, by sending you an email, and/or by
            some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive
            legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your
            email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of
            the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and
            understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the
            Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the
            changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy
            Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
